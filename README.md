# Arc Deployment by GPO
Arc GPO Deployment project contains the necessary files to onboard Non Azure machines to Azure Arc automatically, using a GPO

The project also contains Azure Workbooks to keep track of the onboarding process.

## Content

- [DeployGPO.ps1](DeployGPO.ps1): PowerShell script to deploy the GPO in a certain AD domain
- [EnableAzureArc.ps1](EnableAzureArc.ps1): PowerShell script that has to be placed in the network share and will execute the onboarding process.
- [RenewSPSecret.ps1](RenewSPSecret.ps1): PowerShell script to renew the secret from the Service Principal used for the onboard of Azure Arc Servers.
- [ParseArcOnboardingPrerequisites.ps1](ParseArcOnboardingPrerequisites.ps1): PowerShell scripts that parses the information of the machines that didn't meet the onboard requirements.
- [ArcGPO](ArcGPO): Folder structure that contains the GPO settings to be imported in AD
- [ARMTemplates](ARMTemplates): Folder with Azure Function Template to monitor Azure Arc Agent version updates.
- [Workbooks](Workbooks): Folder with Azure Workbooks to monitor your Azure Arc onboarding Status and your Azure Arc Servers
- [ScheduledTask](ScheduledTask): Folder with a scheduled task that can, programmatically, upload on-prem XMLs report files to Azure Log Analytics

## Prerequisites

- Create a *Service Principal* and give it Azure Arc onbarding permissions, following this article: [Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-service-principal#create-a-service-principal-for-onboarding-at-scale)
  
- Register *Microsoft.HybridCompute*, *Microsoft.GuestConfiguration* and *Microsoft.HybridConnectivity* as resource providers in your subscription, following this article: [Register Resource Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider)

- Create a *Network Share*,e.g. *AzureArcOnboard* that will be used for deployment and reporting files, with the following permissions:

  *Domain Controllers*, *Domain Computers* and *Domain Admins*: Change Permissions

## Installation

### Group Policy Deployment

- Copy the project structure to a local folder of a Domain Controller.

- Fill in *EnableAzureArc.ps1* Powershell Script with the following information from your environment:
  
    *servicePrincipalClientId, tenantid, subscriptionid, ResourceGroup, location, tags* and *ReportServerFQDN*

- Execute the deployment script *DeployGPO.ps1*, with the following syntax:
  
        .\DeployGPO.ps1 -DomainFQDN contoso.com -ReportServerFQDN Server.contoso.com -ArcRemoteShare AzureArcOnBoard -Spsecret $spsecret [-AgentProxy $AgentProxy] [-AssessOnly]

    Where:

    - *Spsecret* is the secret from the Service Principal created previously.

    - *ReportServerFQDN* is the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the host where the network share resides.

    - *ArcRemoteShare* is the name of the network share you've created

    - *AgentProxy* [optional] is the name of the proxy if used

    - *AssessOnly* [optional] makes the GPo to work in Assess mode, no onboarding is done.

- Copy the *'AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi'* file to the *AzureArcDeploy* folder inside the *ArcRemoteShare*. 
    You can download it from https://aka.ms/AzureConnectedMachineAgent



### Azure Worbooks Deployment

  -  #### Workbook - Arc Servers

       - Deploy the Azure Function that checks for the Arc Agent Releases, using this guide: [Azure Function Deployment](/ARMTemplates/Readme.md). This function creates the *AzureARCAgentLatestVersion_CL* log in Log Analytics.
  
       - Create a new Workbook and copy the content from this source json file: [ArcServers.json](/WorkBooks/ArcServers.json):

  -  #### Workbook - Arc Onboarding Status

       - Use either of these methods to upload data from XML files to Log Analytics programmatically. This will populate the *ArcOnboardingStatus_CL* log.

            [Scheduled task](/ScheduledTask/ArcUploadDatatoLA.ps1)

            [Azure Runbook](/Runbook/ArcUploadDatatoLA-Runbook.ps1)


       - Create a new Workbook and copy the content from this source json file: [ArcOnboardingStatus.json](/WorkBooks/ArcOnboardingStatus.json):

## Screenshoots:


* **Azure Workbooks** :

  Azure Arc Onboarded Servers

* Azure Arc Onboarding Status

  Local loging :


A process where the machine already exists in ARC and throws an error AZCM0044:

* Remote Shared Loging :

In this case, **328** Servers don't meet the requirements and are waiting to be onboarded in azure Arc:
